# Week 2 Design Patterns -  Joseph Whiteaker 

## Note 
- Project is done in Typescript
 Why? Because, I have genuiely never worked with Java before (I just transferred here this year), so I was having a ton of trouble trying to figure out how to do do some of the things that I wanted to do in Java that I can easily do in other langauges. However, I do know Typescript which reads very similarly bc of their strict typing, similar syntax and object methods, and massive boilerplate code and with it being very easy to run typescript locally, I figured the general purpose of the assignment was still achieved even in another langauge. 
- The comment structure stills follows the java guide 


# Instructions 
- navigate to the week2 directory. 
- Run the command

	  npm i 
	  
- Then run the command 
	
	  npm start 

- This should console.log the values out to the terminal as Java, Python, c++, or any other scripting language would. 

- if 'npm isn't a command' is showing up on your terminal, simply google nodejs and download newest node lts (long term support).
